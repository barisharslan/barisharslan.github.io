                <p>I actually discovered Patatap last year, and playing around with it helped motivate me to start writing my own music using my computer. So it was a pleasant surprise seeing that there was a project on my Udemy Web Development Bootcamp class that was to make a clone of this awesome little site. <br><br>I started off following the instructor's format, but ended up going all out and making a unique animation for every sound. It's not completely done yet, and the code is very messy right now. Once all animations are done, my plan is going to be to go back and refactor everything, following what I would say a class based approach to generate the animations. <br><br>I used paper.js to generate the animations. It took a bit to understand the flow of the library, which did end up leading to a not so efficient first attempt. Now that I've really taken in how paper.js works, I am confident in improving this project in efficiency and quality. I also used howler.js to handle the sounds being played, which is so simple I didn't run into a single problem.</p>

                <img class="project-pic" src="assets/images/colorgame.gif" alt="assets/images/colorgame.png">
                <p>This was also a project for my Udemy class, which I tried my best to improve and make unique. This is actually my second attempt at the project. When I saw the project, I decided to give it a shot without following along with the instructor, which ultimately led to what you would call "spaghetti code". It got so complicated I forgot that all I was making was a simple guessing game. <br><br> So I gave up and started over, following the instructor. I caught many problems I had overlooked the first time and came out understanding Javascript a great deal more. I finally gave it another shot using jQuery, and also added a difficulty selector, and it gets tough! All that is happening is that the range of possible colors for each square gets tighter and tighter as the difficulty goes up. At the insane difficulty, there is only a range of Â± 10 for each value. <br><br> This project uses jQuery for easy DOM manipulation and Bootstrap for appearance. </p>

                <img class="project-pic" src="assets/images/webwizard.gif" alt="">
                <p>This was made to speed up my progress through my Udemy class. I always like to follow along with examples over just watching and taking notes, so I always ended up making the files and coding along with the instructor. As each video ended up needing an html, css, and js file, all linked together, I got sick of having to create them manually each time. <br><br> I used the simple power of Python to make a little script that will create these files for me, with an option to exclude certain files if need be. It can also launch the files in your selected program, though that part might not work well currently depending on the selected program. <br><br> I used a library called PySimpleGUI, which is a wrapper for tKinter, the core python library for GUIs. Please <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/">check it out</a>  if you want to get something up and running super quick, and refine it easily later.</p>

                <p>As you can see from the URL, I made this site using Github Pages. I really liked how easy it was to just be able to push my local repo to Github and have it show up as a functioning website! I used jQuery and Bootstrap, and tried my best to make a responsibe and minimal design. This was my first attempt at making a complete website from scratch, and not using something like Wordpress. I learned a lot from this process, and I want to continually improve this site and make it aesthetically pleasing as well as effective. <br><br> I didn't do anything too clever, just stock jQuery animations and a Bootstrap built theme.
